# Webpack-React

## This is boilerplate for a react application with webpack4.
This is what I think is minimal substitution for `create-react-app`.

**Note:**
- Everything up-to-date as of 2nd May, 2019
- ESLint with custom configurations. Alter as per your style/needs
- Webpack dev server with hot reload and new tab on port 9000
- HtmlWebpackPlugin with index.html as template

To start:
`npm run start`

To build:
`npm run build`
